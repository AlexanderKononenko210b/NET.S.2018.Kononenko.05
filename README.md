Develop a class that allows you to perform GCD computations using Euclid's algorithm for two, three, etc. of integers. Add to the developed class methods that implement the Stein algorithm (Euclid's binary algorithm) to calculate the GCD of two, three, etc. of integers. Develop unit-tests for testing methods of this type. (NUnit framework)


Implement the extension method to obtain a string binary representation of a real double-precision number in the IEEE 754 format (do not use the converted converter classes!). Develop unit tests. (NUnit framework).


Implement the method of extending the output from a string representation of an integer positive four-byte number written in the p-ary number system (2 <= p <= 16), its decimal value. Develop unit tests. (NUnit framework).
